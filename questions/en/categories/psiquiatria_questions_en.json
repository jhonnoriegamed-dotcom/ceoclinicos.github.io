      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Heightened self-esteem, which is a common symptom, can become so salient that it takes on a delusional quality. In these cases, ideas of greatness are congruent with the euphoric state of mind, manifesting in beliefs of possessing extraordinary abilities or powers."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,

      "explanation": "A clinical case described highlights that, during the phases of exaltation, the patient showed great focused productivity, producing an enormous volume of essays on very diverse topics. This productive hyperactivity, without psychosis or excessive spending, is key in the diagnosis of hypomania."

      "explanation": "Although the patient in the clinical case felt her 'connection' was uncomfortable, she did not perceive herself as delusional.
