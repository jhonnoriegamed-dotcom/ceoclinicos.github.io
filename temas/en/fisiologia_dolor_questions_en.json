      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The brain filters an immense amount of sensory information because it is of no immediate importance or interest, such as the feel of clothing or the pressure of a seat.

      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The cerebral cortex is the region of greatest evolutionary development and acts as an enormous and vast storehouse of memories, a repository of information that, when associated with the lower centers, converts the basic functions of the nervous system into precise and decisive operations, and is fundamental for the processes of conscious thought."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two main types of synapses in the body?",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Chemical synapses, which are the most common in the human nervous system, use neurotransmitters to transmit the signal, while electrical synapses directly connect the cytoplasms of adjacent cells through gap junctions that allow the free and rapid movement of ions."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Acetylcholine belongs to Class I of small molecule, fast-acting transmitters. These transmitters are essential for immediate responses of the nervous system, such as the transmission of sensory or motor signals, unlike neuropeptides that usually cause slower and more prolonged actions."

        "-90 mV hyperpolarized"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The resting potential is set at -65 mV in most central neurons. This negative value inside the membrane is crucial to maintain the neuron in a state ready to be activated or inhibited by external stimuli, thanks to a balance of ions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What potential value indicates an excited neuron?",
      "options": [

        "Equal to resting potential",
        "-90 mV potential"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "An excited neuron shows a potential that becomes less negative (such as -45 mV) as it depolarizes. This change is due to the influx of positively charged ions, which brings the potential closer to the firing threshold of an action potential."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which ion enters the neuron to cause excitation?",
      "options": [
        "potassium ion",

        "sodium ion",
        "calcium ion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Arousal is caused by a neurotransmitter that increases the permeability of the membrane to sodium ions. These ions, due to their large concentration gradient, rapidly diffuse inward, initiating depolarization and neuronal excitation."

        "calcium ion",
        "potassium ion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "A key form of neuronal inhibition is the efflux of potassium ions. This movement of positive ions out of the cell causes the membrane potential to become even more negative, entering a state of hyperpolarization that reduces its excitability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which ion can enter to achieve inhibition?",
      "options": [
        "sodium ion",

        "Chloride ion",
        "calcium ion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The entry of chloride ions (negative) through the neuronal membrane is a powerful inhibition mechanism. By increasing internal negativity, chloride hyperpolarizes the cell, making it significantly more difficult to generate a nerve impulse."
    },
    {
      "question": "What membrane potential is an example of an inhibited state?",
      "options": [
        "-45mV",

        "-70mV",
        "0 mV"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "A potential of -70 mV is more negative than the normal resting potential of -65 mV. This state is achieved by hyperpolarization and represents an inhibited neuron, meaning that it is more difficult for it to fire an action potential."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Type C fibers are distinguished by their small size and the absence of myelin (unmyelinated), which results in extremely slow conduction of nerve impulses, being important in the transmission of dull and visceral pain."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Due to their small diameter and lack of myelin, Type C fibers have the slowest conduction velocities. This contrasts with Type A fibers, which use myelin for much faster and more efficient impulse transmission."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The state where the membrane potential becomes more negative than the normal resting potential (e.g. -70 mV) is called hyperpolarization. This inhibited state requires much greater excitation to reach the threshold necessary to fire an action potential."
