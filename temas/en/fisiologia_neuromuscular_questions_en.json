        "The viscosity of the internal medium"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The net diffusion rate of a substance through the cell membrane is directly proportional to the concentration gradient, that is, the difference between the concentration outside and inside the cell. This principle drives the passive movement of molecules across the membrane without the expenditure of energy by the cell."
    },
    {

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules across a membrane with selective permeability, caused by a difference in water concentration. This movement occurs from the side with a higher concentration of water (lower solute) to the side with a lower concentration of water (higher solute)."

        "Facilitated dissemination",
        "active transport"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Active transport is the process by which cell membranes move molecules or ions 'against the current', that is, against a concentration, electrical or pressure gradient. This process always requires a supply of energy that comes directly from cellular metabolism."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The sodium-potassium pump is a primary active transport mechanism that pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions it pumps from the outside into the cell. As a result, there is a net loss of a positive charge outward with each pumping cycle."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the ratio of Na^+ expelled to K^+ introduced into the pump?",
      "options": [

        "Four Na^+ times one K^+"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Na^+-K^+ pump transports three Na^+ ions out of the cell and simultaneously pumps two K^+ ions into the cell. This three-by-two stoichiometry is essential not only for maintaining ionic concentration gradients, but also for creating a negative electrical potential within the cell."
    },
    {

        "transports amino acids"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The Na^+-K^+ pump is electrogenic because it displaces three positive charges (Na^+) outward for every two positive charges (K^+) it displaces inward. This action generates a net electrical potential across the membrane, making the inside of the cell more negative, a fundamental requirement for nerve signals."
    },
    {

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "One of the most critical functions of the Na^+-K^+ pump is continuous monitoring to maintain normal cell volume. By pumping more ions outward than inward, it initiates outward osmosis of water, counteracting the tendency of intracellular proteins to draw water inward and preventing the cell from exploding."

        "Lipid hydrolysis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "In secondary active transport, the energy comes from the ionic concentration gradient, usually sodium, that was previously generated by primary active transport. This stored energy is released when the ion moves down its gradient, and this energy drags other substances against its own gradient."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is secondary active transport called where a substance moves in the same direction as the propellant ion?",
      "options": [

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Cotransport is a form of secondary active transport where a carrier protein binds two or more different substances and moves them together across the cell membrane in the same direction. A notable example is sodium-glucose cotransport, which relies on the sodium gradient created by the Na^+-K^+ pump."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Sodium-calcium countertransport, a secondary active mechanism, occurs in virtually all cell membranes. In this process, a sodium ion moves inward down its gradient, providing the energy to move a calcium ion out of the cell against its own gradient, keeping its intracellular concentration low."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "At normal body temperature of 37^C, a concentration of one osmole of dissolved solute per liter of solution exerts an osmotic pressure of 19,300 mmHg (19.3 mmHg per mosmol). This value is crucial for calculating the total osmotic pressure of body fluids, although this is slightly lower in reality due to the interaction of the ions."

        "The density of the solution"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The osmotic pressure exerted by a solution is determined exclusively by the number of solute particles per unit volume, known as molar concentration, and not by the individual mass of these particles. This is because all particles, regardless of their mass, have the same average kinetic energy at a given temperature."
