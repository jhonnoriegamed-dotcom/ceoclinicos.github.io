      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Glucose homeostasis is regulated by the interaction of insulin (anabolic and hypoglycemic) and **glucagon**. Glucagon is a **catabolic and hyperglycemic hormone** because it stimulates hepatic glucose production (gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis) to raise blood sugar levels."

      "question": "What is the main risk factor for IR?",
      "options": [
        "viral infection",
        "Visceral obesity",
        "Oxidative stress",
        "Amyloid"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Visceral (or central) obesity is identified as the main risk factor for Insulin Resistance (IR) in DM2. Dysfunctional adipose tissue releases excessive free fatty acids, initiating lipotoxicity and chronic low-grade inflammation, which interfere with insulin signaling."

      "question": "What autoantibody is a marker of DM1?",
      "options": [
        "Anti-GAD65",

        "Anti-GLUT4",
        "Anti-HLA-DR4"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Autoantibodies are key markers of the autoimmune process of DM1. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (anti-GAD65) is one of the main autoantibodies, along with anti-insulin (IAA) and anti-tyrosine phosphatase (anti-IA2) antibodies, that indicate beta cell destruction."

      "question": "What metabolic consequence does ketogenesis produce?",
      "options": [
        "Hyperinsulinism",
        "Lipolysis",
        "Glucotoxicity",
        "Glycation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The absolute insulin deficiency in DM1 leads to a catabolic state, activating **lipolysis** in adipose tissue. This massively releases free fatty acids (FFA) which, when oxidized in the liver (beta-oxidation), produce ketone bodies, which can lead to Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)."

      "question": "What protein inhibits insulin in IR?",
      "options": [
        "IRS-1",
        "Adiponectin",
        "GLUT4",
        "Glucagon"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In insulin resistance (IR), ectopically accumulated lipids activate Protein Kinase C (PKC). This enzyme phosphorylates **Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS-1)** on serine/threonine residues, which interferes with its normal signaling and inhibits the complete action of insulin in tissues."

        "Amyloidosis",
        "Hyperglucagonemia"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "One of the earliest and most crucial defects in beta cell dysfunction in T2DM is the **loss of the first phase of insulin secretion**. It refers to the rapid peak of insulin release that occurs immediately after a meal, essential for controlling hepatic glucose production and postprandial peripheral uptake."

        "Amylase",
        "SGLT2"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "One of the key metabolic pathways in microvascular damage due to chronic hyperglycemia is the polyol pathway. The enzyme **aldose reductase** converts excess glucose into sorbitol. The accumulation of sorbitol causes osmotic stress and depletes the antioxidant system, damaging tissues such as the lens and nerves."

      "question": "Which pathway damages vessels by non-enzymatic glycation?",
      "options": [
        "Polyols",
        "Hexosamine",
        "AGEs",
        "PKC"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The formation of Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) is an important damage pathway. It occurs when glucose reacts non-enzymatically with proteins and lipids, a process called glycation. The resulting AGEs accumulate, causing vascular stiffness and endothelial damage, which are the basis of chronic complications."
