      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The ampulla of Vater, formed by the union of the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct, drains its contents (bile and pancreatic juice) into the duodenum at the apex of the greater caruncle or greater duodenal papilla. This is the main entry point for bile and pancreatic secretion."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The sphincter of the common bile duct, or sphincter of Oddi, is under the control of both the autonomic nervous system and various gastrointestinal hormones. This double regulation ensures that bile is released in a coordinated manner with the arrival of food to the duodenum for fat digestion."

      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The right and left functional portions of the liver receive, respectively, the right and left branches of the portal vein and the hepatic artery proper. This vascular distribution is the criterion for the functional segmentation of the liver, which is more precise than the anatomical division by the falciform ligament."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The endocrine portion of the pancreas is made up of pancreatic islets, which are small groups of cells scattered throughout the gland. These cells are crucial because they release the hormone insulin directly into the bloodstream through capillaries that abundantly supply them."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Afferent pain fibers originating in the bile ducts, due to distension or spasm, reach the spinal cord via the splanchnic nerves. This explains the intensity and possible irradiation of biliary pain."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The splenic artery usually originates from the celiac trunk, a major branch of the aorta. From there, it follows a sinuous path to the left, near the upper edge of the body of the pancreas, to supply the spleen and give off pancreatic and gastric branches."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The Latin word for kidney is 'ren', from which the adjective 'renal' is directly derived. The term 'nephros' is the Greek word for kidney, giving rise to the adjective 'nephritic', but 'renal' is the direct Latin adjective commonly used in anatomy."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The extraperitoneal tissue that externally surrounds the kidney condenses and forms a structure known as renal fascia. This fascia, when directed inward, divides into an anterior and a posterior leaf, creating a compartment that surrounds and supports the kidney and adrenal gland."

      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The general arrangement of the structures in the renal hilum indicates that, behind the renal arteries, the renal pelvis and ureter are located. This arrangement is the most 'typical', with the veins at the front, the arteries in the middle and the pelvis/ureter in the most posterior position."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The renal fascia divides to envelop the kidney. The anterior leaf of this fascia is the one that extends and continues through the median plane, crossing the central line of the body. The posterior leaf, on the other hand, is fused with connective tissue in front of the vertebral column."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The adjective 'nephritic', used to refer to inflammation or disease of the kidney, is derived from the Greek word 'nephros'. The Latin term 'ren' gives rise to the adjective 'renal', which simply refers to something related to the kidney."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'typical' arrangement of elements in the renal hilum states that both veins and arteries are, for the most part, anterior to the renal pelvis and ureter. The vein is the most anterior, followed by the artery and finally the pelvis and ureter in the most posterior position."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In some cases, a rare anomaly can be observed in the left renal vein where, instead of being multiple, it divides and forms a periaortic venous ring. This means that the divided vein goes around the abdominal aorta, being an unusual anatomical variation."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Inferiorly, the sheets of renal fascia are weakly fused. At this point of fusion, the lamellae emerge together with the surrounding extraperitoneal connective tissue, which surrounds the structure of the ureter, thus continuing the wrapping of the structures of the urinary system."
