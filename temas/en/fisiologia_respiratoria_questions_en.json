    {
      "question": "What happens to the internal pressure of the lungs in a positive pressure ventilator?",
      "options": [
        "It is equal to the atmospheric",
        "It is reduced a lot",
        "It gets older than the rest",
        "There is no notable change"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "When a ventilator introduces air into the lungs at positive pressure, the resulting pressure inside the lungs rises and becomes significantly higher than the average pressure present in other areas of the body. This pressure gradient is what drives air in for ventilation."

    {
      "question": "What circulatory effect is a common consequence of assisted ventilation?",
      "options": [
        "Increased cardiac output",
        "Obstacle to venous flow",
        "Lowering blood pressure",
        "Improved arterial return"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "El aumento de la presión dentro del tórax, ya sea por ventilación de presión positiva o por la presión negativa externa del respirador de tanque, obstaculiza la capacidad de la sangre para fluir desde las venas periféricas hacia el tórax y el corazón. This results in a reduction in venous return."
    },
    {
      "question": "From which peripheral veins is blood return mainly hindered?",
      "options": [
        "peripheral veins",
        "coronary veins",
        "pulmonary veins",
        "renal veins"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Because the pressure inside the lungs and chest rises during assisted ventilation, this imposes resistance or an obstacle to the flow of blood coming from the blood vessels furthest from the heart, specifically from the peripheral veins, making it difficult for it to reach the heart and chest."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ions are relevant in the final chemical control of respiration?",
      "options": [
        "Hydrogen ions (mathbfH^+)",
        "Sodium ions (mathbfNa^+)",
        "Potassium ions (mathbfK^+)",
        "Calcium ions (mathbfCa^2+)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Among the chemical factors that play a significant role in the final adjustment of respiration are concentrations of O_2, CO_2, and, specifically, hydrogen ions (H^+). Control of these ions is vital to keep the pH of body fluids as close to normal as possible."

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of intense nerve signals in exercise?",
      "options": [
        "Reduce fatigue",
        "Conserve CO_2",
        "Raise H^+ ions",
        "Provide the additional O_2"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "During the performance of an exercise, direct nervous signals stimulate the respiratory center so that it works at a magnitude almost identical to that necessary to ensure the supply of additional oxygen (O_2) required by the body to sustain muscle contraction and increased metabolic activity."
    },
    {
      "question": "At what point does most of the ventilatory increase from exercise begin?",
      "options": [
        "After five minutes",
        "At the end of the warm-up",
        "When CO_2 rises",
        "Immediately upon startup"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The person experiences a total increase in ventilation largely immediately, that is, as soon as they begin to perform the exercise. This rapid onset demonstrates that most of the increase is not based solely on the response to late chemical changes in the blood."

    {
      "question": "What is the key piece that activates air movement inside the tank?",
      "options": [
        "A leather activated diaphragm",
        "A manual O_2 pump",
        "One-way air valve",
        "A ventilation grill"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The essential mechanism that allows pressure variation within the tank respirator is a diaphragm, usually made of leather, which is activated by a motor. This diaphragm moves back and forth, with enough movement to modify the pressure inside the tank and thus generate artificial respiration."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you keep the connection between the head and the tank breather airtight?",
      "options": [
        "With a hard mask",
        "With adhesive bandages",
        "Using a thick layer",
        "Through a flexible and watertight collar"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The tank respirator is designed so that only the patient's head protrudes from the device, while the rest of the body remains inside. To prevent pressure leaks and ensure a tight seal, a flexible but watertight collar is used to seal the opening around the patient's neck."
    },
    {
      "question": "What direction does the leather diaphragm take to generate expiratory pressure?",
      "options": [
        "Towards the patient's head",
        "Without moving at all",
        "Moves inward",
        "Out of the tank"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "To generate the positive pressure that induces expiration in the tank respirator, the leather diaphragm is driven by the motor in an inward direction, that is, closer to the patient's body. This movement reduces the volume of air in the tank, thus increasing the pressure around the body."
    },
    {
      "question": "What direction does the leather diaphragm take to generate inspiratory pressure?",
      "options": [
        "moves out",
        "Towards the patient's body",
        "Moves towards the diaphragm",
        "Towards the center of the tank"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The leather diaphragm moves outward, away from the patient's body, to create the negative pressure environment. This change in volume inside the tank reduces the pressure around the patient, allowing chest expansion and subsequent inspiration of air."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is kept closest to normal with the final breathing setting?",
      "options": [
        "muscle tone",
        "glucose level",
        "body temperature",
        "Gas and ion concentrations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The role of chemical factors, in conjunction with nervous signals, is to ensure the final adjustment of respiration so that the concentrations of O_2, CO_2 and hydrogen ions (H^+) are maintained in the body fluids as close to normal as possible. This guarantees the homeostasis of the body."

    {
      "question": "Using excessive pressures with assisted ventilation can cause an obstacle to:",
      "options": [
        "Peripheral arterial flow",
        "Thoracic lymph flow",
        "venous return",
        "nerve conduction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Applying too high pressures, whether with a positive pressure ventilator or tank respirator, has the adverse effect of significantly impeding the venous return of blood to the heart. This occurs because the increased intrathoracic pressure compresses the large veins, making it difficult for blood to flow to the chest."
    },
    {
      "question": "The intrapulmonary pressure in assisted ventilation is greater than:",
      "options": [
        "Pressure in the rest of the body",
        "Mean blood pressure",
        "central venous pressure",
        "atmospheric pressure"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When a ventilator or tank respirator is used, air is introduced or the chest is expanded, resulting in a pressure inside the lungs that rises and is higher than the pressure found elsewhere in the body. This pressure differential is key to understanding the circulatory implications."
